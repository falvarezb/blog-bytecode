    * Note: the paths are stored on a mutable ListBuffer for efficiency
    *
    * The process to calculate the neighbours of a given vertex is specific for every type of graph and is implemented
    * by the method 'neighbours'. The method 'isVertexEligibleForPath' filters the neighbours that are eligible to be
    * included in the present path (for instance, in most cases it is desirable not to visit twice the same vertex).
    * The method 'addNeighbours' determines the way the graph is traversed: breadth-first or depth-first.
    *
    *
    * It is worth noticing that the present algorithm to traverse the graph is very generic and therefore sub-optimal
    * for problems like finding the shortest path between 2 vertices as the different paths do not share information
    * about vertices already visited.
